# Unsupervised-Anomaly-Detection-for-Risk-Identification

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks implementing various unsupervised anomaly detection techniques. These models are used for detecting anomalies in time-series financial data, focusing on detecting risk events in spending behavior.

Models implemented :-

1. Isolation Forest
2. One-Class SVM
3. LSTM Autoencoders
