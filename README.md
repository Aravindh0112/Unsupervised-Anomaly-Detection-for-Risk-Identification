# Unsupervised-Anomaly-Detection-for-Risk-Identification

## Overview:

This repository goes beyond traditional anomaly detection by focusing on identifying risk events in financial spending data. It recognizes that not all anomalies indicate risk, and the models are designed to distinguish between typical anomalies and those that signify potential risk events. This approach enhances precision in financial risk management by targeting meaningful outliers.

## Dataset:

It is a time series data provided by Lloyds Bank and is not of public access.

## Phases covered:

1. Data Preprocessing
