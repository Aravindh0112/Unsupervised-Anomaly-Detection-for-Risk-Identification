# Unsupervised-Anomaly-Detection-for-Risk-Identification

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks implementing various unsupervised anomaly detection techniques. These models are used to detect anomalies in time-series financial data, focusing on detecting risk events in spending behavior.

Models Implemented:-

1. Isolation Forest
2. One Class SVM
3. LSTM Autoencoder
