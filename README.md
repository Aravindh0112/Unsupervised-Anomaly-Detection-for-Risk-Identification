# Unsupervised-Anomaly-Detection-for-Risk-Identification

Several unsupervised anomaly detection techniques aimed at identifying anomalies in time series financial data are implemented here. The models focus on detection irregularities and risk events in spending patterns.

Models Implemented:-

1. Isolation Forest
2. One Class SVM
3. LSTM Autoencoder
